# Restaurant-Page
This project is a restaurant website that uses tabbed browsing to access the Contact and Menu pages. The website is built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Webpack. The content for each tab is organized into separate modules to keep the code clean and maintainable.

# Tab-Switching Logic
The tab-switching logic is implemented in the index.js file. Event listeners are set up for each tab, allowing users to switch between the Menu and Contact tabs. When a tab is clicked, the current contents of the content div are cleared, and the appropriate tab module is invoked to populate it with the corresponding content.

# Webpack Integration
This project also serves as an opportunity to learn and demonstrate the use of Webpack for bundling JavaScript modules. Webpack helps organize and bundle the various JavaScript files into a single, optimized file for better performance and maintainability.
